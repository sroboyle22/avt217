    <p>Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to be.</p>
    <p>And whatever your labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life, keep peace in your soul.</p>
    <p>With all its sham, drudgery and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world.</p>
    <p>Be cheerful.</p>
    <p>Strive to be happy.</p>
